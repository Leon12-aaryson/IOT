Product Requirements Document (PRD) for IoT Application
1. Overview
This PRD specifies the requirements for an IoT application focused on monitoring and managing submersible pump systems. The application will offer functionalities like historical data analysis, device management, and real-time monitoring.

2. Key Features
2.1 Overview Dashboard (Historical Data)
Purpose: To provide a comprehensive view of historical performance data for each device registered under a user's account.

Core Functionality:
Data Display:
Show metrics like efficiency, voltage stability, current, temperature, RPM, and power output. Include average values for each parameter.
Filtering Options:
Time Frames: Day, Week, Month, Year.
Custom Date Range: Users can input specific start and end dates for detailed analysis.
Data Visualization:
Use dynamic graphs and charts that adjust according to the selected time frame.
Device Identification:
Ensure all data is linked to devices via unique serial numbers for precise tracking.

2.2 Device List Page
Purpose: To offer an organized interface for managing and accessing devices.

Core Functionality:
Device Listing:
List all devices with their serial numbers.
Navigation:
Quick links to individual device dashboards and historical data.
Search and Filter:
Search: By device name.
Filter: By device serial number.

2.3 Individual Device Dashboard (Real-Time Monitoring)
Purpose: To provide real-time operational insights into each active device.

Core Functionality:
Real-Time Data:
Update live metrics including:
RPM and efficiency.
Voltage stability, power output.
Device and ambient temperatures.
Phase voltages (L1, L2, L3) with average calculations.
Panel voltage and solar power input.
Visual Alerts:
Indicators for:
Overvoltage (OV)
Undervoltage (UV)
Control Features:
An ON/OFF toggle for device control.
Trend Analysis:
Interactive graphs showing trends in RPM, power, and voltage stability.

3. Technical Requirements
Scalability: The system must handle an increasing number of devices without performance degradation.
Security: Implement robust data encryption for all communications and ensure user authentication for device access.
Compatibility: Support for multiple device types (iOS, Android, Web browsers).
Data Storage: Efficient storage solutions for managing and archiving large datasets of historical data.
API: Develop RESTful APIs for integration with other systems or for future enhancements.

4. User Experience (UX) Considerations
Intuitive Interface: Design for ease of use, ensuring that even non-technical users can navigate and use the system effectively.
Accessibility: Compliance with WCAG guidelines for accessibility.
Performance: Fast load times for real-time data and seamless transitions between different views.

5. Performance Metrics
Response Time: Real-time data updates should occur within 2 seconds.
Accuracy: Data should be accurate to within Â±1% of actual readings.
Uptime: Aim for 99.9% uptime for the service.

6. Development Timeline
Phase 1: Core functionality for device listing and basic historical data (3 months).
Phase 2: Real-time monitoring dashboard implementation (2 months).
Phase 3: Advanced features like custom date range filters, enhanced data visualization, and device control (3 months).

7. Testing
Unit Testing: For individual components.
Integration Testing: To ensure all parts of the system work together.
User Acceptance Testing (UAT): With a select group of users to validate the system meets user needs.
